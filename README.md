Repository of genetic algorithm scripts

FF_GA is a fantasy football genetic algorithm that performs the search with the objective of maximizing fantasy points subject to a salary cap constraint.  The population size is 1000, the genome size is 9, the probability of mutation is 5%, and the selection method used is tournament selection.  The script needs to be cleaned up to eliminate all of the inefficient for loops.
